	`Listen here <@${targetId}>, let me tell you about the **Horde**. Not the ragtag bands you may have heard of ‚Äî but the unstoppable tide of history. The Horde doesn't ask for permission. It arrives. It conquers. It remains.`,

	`Centuries ago, the world trembled beneath the hooves of Mongolian steeds. Genghis Khan carved an empire not with whispers, but with **absolute will**. Cities burned, kings bent the knee, and maps were redrawn in dust and blood.`,

	`But from that mighty line came a refinement. A rebirth. A crystallization of power into purpose. And from it emerged the **Finngolians** ‚Äî descendants of fire and ice, minds sharp as sabers, hearts colder than tundra winters.`,

	`You see, <@${targetId}>, the Finngolian legacy isn't just inherited ‚Äî it's earned. Forged in battle, sealed in silence, written in the blood of challengers. We do not forget. We do not forgive. We endure.`,

	`So next time you speak the name of the Horde, speak it with reverence. Because when the Finngolians ride... the world **doesn't sleep**. It watches. It wonders. And then... it kneels.`,

	`And now, <@${targetId}>... listen well. Before you stands <@${Users.Finngolian}> ‚Äî **Warlord of the Finngolians**, commander of ice-born legions.\n\nTo him, you owe your loyalty.\n\nBut beyond him stands <@${Users.Daeryox}>, the **Khan of Khanates** ‚Äî the eternal flame to whom the Finngolians pledge their sacred allegiance. Remember this, and remember your place.`

	`Look, <@${targetId}>. People may mock the piles of materials, gear, and obscure crafting components you stash. But they don‚Äôt understand: **this isn‚Äôt clutter ‚Äî it‚Äôs preparation**.`,

	`In **Throne and Liberty**, today's vendor trash is tomorrow's treasure. The man who hoards is the man who controls the market when scarcity hits. You‚Äôre not just playing the game ‚Äî you‚Äôre setting the economy‚Äôs pulse.`,

	`They see disorganized bags. You see **options**. When others scramble for one rare drop, you calmly withdraw it from your vault, unbothered, while they offer their soul for a trade.`,

	`It's not hoarding. It's **4D chess**. Where others think one step ahead, you think in patches, events, seasonal reruns. You don‚Äôt waste. You **invest**. And the dividends are power.`,

	`So keep stacking, <@${targetId}>. Let them laugh now. Because when the world burns, they‚Äôll come crawling to you ‚Äî the Hoarder King, the silent architect of survival.`,

	`And when the time comes ‚Äî when the servers reset, the drop rates nerf, and the clueless cry for help ‚Äî you will open your vault, whisper nothing‚Ä¶ and profit in silence.\n\n<:EvilPepe:1379921183805411348>`
